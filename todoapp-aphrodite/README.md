> The original refactored using [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite)

This directory contains the original files refactored to use Aphrodite. No build process changes were required.

**Refactor Note**

Because Aphrodite requires styles be formatted as a JavaScript object, I ran `public/styles.css` through a series of RegEx replacements to prepare it for copy-pasting. The prepared file is included here: `public/styles.css.txt`.
